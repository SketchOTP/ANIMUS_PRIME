# Project Decision and Milestone Record Template

After adoption, use this append-only record for major durable project events and decisions, not routine task outcomes.

## Entry guidance after adoption

Use it for architectural decisions, governance changes, releases, qualification or certification events, major reversals, important milestones, and decision supersessions.

Each live entry should include:

- Date.
- Record or decision ID.
- Status.
- Decision or event.
- Rationale.
- Affected areas.
- Supersession relationship when applicable.

Allowed status values are `PROPOSED`, `ACTIVE`, `SUPERSEDED`, `REVERSED`, and `CLOSED`.

Do not add live decisions or milestones to this template. Examples must remain outside the shipped template state.
